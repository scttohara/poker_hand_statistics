# poker_hand_statistics

**I do realize the names are slightly too similar but these were the required names when I wrote this for a class**

**1.** card_tests.py contains the tests for determining the current hand.

**2.** deal_and_test.py contains the main logic for running the total number of hands, input by the user, and calculating the overall final statistical output.

**3.** test_for_card_tests.py has 27 tests written in python unittest framework to test the logic of the simulator files.

To run the simulator use on the command line use: **python3 deal_and_test.py**

Run any number of poker hands (tested up to 100 million hands) and get back the statistical breakdown and what poker hands were distributed


**results of running the simulation 100 million times**

#To get a picture in a README read below!!
Used this link to figure out how to get an image in here (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)...FYI a quick summary --> Open a new issue (under issues), drop the picture file in to the comment area of the issue..wait for github to process what you dropped in...then copy what github prints in the comment area when the picture is done processing. You can leave that page, go back to your read me and *paste* and when you "commit changes" the picture will be there!!!!
