#To get a picture in a README read below!!
Used this link to figure out how to get an image in here (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)...FYI a quick summary --> Open a new issue (under issues), drop the picture file in to the comment area of the issue..wait for github to process what you dropped in...then copy what github prints in the comment area when the picture is done processing. You can leave that page, go back to your read me and *paste* and when you "commit changes" the picture will be there!!!!
